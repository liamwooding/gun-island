#Welcome To Gun Island

## 2D Synchronous turn-based gunfighter MMO
###A rich physical simulation of a world where the only verb is Shoot

The aim is to have a physics-driven game which allows an arbitrary number of players to drop in and out at any time.

- Drag away from your character to aim a shot
- Shots have kickback
- Explosions will fling characters around
- These are your only means of propulsion
